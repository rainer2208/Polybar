# Polybar

This a polybar I have created for LeftWM, but should work on all platforms. 

I am working on ArcoLinux, using LeftWM/ i3.

I have made a few adaptations, like whe you click on "updates" urxvt opens and the update command is alreay in the terminal. 

Special thanks to Erik Dubois, the one who has best helped me understand Linux.
